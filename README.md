Hangman-Project-2023
1st. project for JavaScript


Our 1st. project is to build a classic game of Hangman using Node.js and all the topics that we have covered in class.

Hangman is a word game where the computer randomly picks a Word from a wordBank and the player makes letter selections one at a time until they run out of guess or they WIN the game. Whether they win or lose they will be prompted to play again. While they are paying their wins and losses will be tracked. The object of the game is to guess the correct word so your hangman is displayed.

Hope you enjoy!
